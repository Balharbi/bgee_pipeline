# Bgee single-cell RNA-Seq analysis pipeline

The scRNA-Seq analysis pipeline is divided in two sub-pipelines:

1) To treat full-lenght protocols [bgee_pipeline/pipeline/scRNA_Seq/Full_Length_Protocols/](bgee_pipeline/pipeline/scRNA_Seq/Full_Length_Protocols/)

2) To treat target-based protocols [bgee_pipeline/pipeline/scRNA_Seq/Droplet_based_Protocols/](bgee_pipeline/pipeline/scRNA_Seq/Droplet_based_Protocols/)
