6239	Caenorhabditis elegans	5	4	3	Right	3	Left	"Intergenic gaussians numerous but located close frome aech other: selected the major one (3). Very peculiar coding distributions: removed 2 left-most since they have a lot of genes and are very lowly expressed, so probably over-annotation"	JR
7217	Drosophila ananassae	3	2	2	Right	1	Left	"Selected gaussian 1 intergenic only. Gaussian 1 coding genic contains a lot of lowly expressed genes on the left: over-annotation?"	JR
7227	Drosophila melanogaster	2	3	2	Right	2	Left	Gaussian 3 intergenic very small and on the right: removed. Gaussian 1 coding contains a lot of lowly expressed genes on the left: over-annotation?	JR

9365	Erinaceus europaeus	2	2	2	Right	2	Right	"Intergenic regions are are deconvoluted into 2 gaussians, but they overlap (1 is broader than 2). Intergenic overlaps a lot with coding too. Selecting gaussian 2 was removing some regions on the right of the distribution, but very few, which resulted in very low proportion of coding expressed. Now removing gaussian 2 - we set it to be on the right of the selected regions. Removed left-most coding gaussian (1)."	JR
9544	Macaca mulatta	2	5	2	Right	2	Left	Removed right-most intergenic gaussians (4 and 5). Gaussians 1 and 3 do not seem attributed to any region. Removed left-most coding gaussian (1).	JR
