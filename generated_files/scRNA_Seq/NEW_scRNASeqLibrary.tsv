Brain tissue was obtained from living subjects who underwent temporal lobectomy for medically refractory seizures and mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). In these patients, a small piece (0.5–3 g) of anterior temporal lobe was resected during the surgical approach to deeper areas of the brain and was considered normal by all detectable means including electroencephalogram (EEG) and pathological examination. We also performed a set of experiments with cortex from prenatal brain at the age of 16–18 weeks postgestation.	ANN	2019-11-26	NA	NA	SRS910177	scRNA-seq	SMARTer Ultra Low	Full-length	NA
